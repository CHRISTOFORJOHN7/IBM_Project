# IBM_Project
# House Price Prediction

## Introduction

This project aims to predict house prices using machine learning. The project is divided into several phases, each addressing a different aspect of the AI development process.

We used a real-world dataset provided for our project by IBM named "USA_Housing" for our analysis of house prices.

## Requirements

Before running the project code, make sure you have the following packages installed:

bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost matplotlib seaborn

If you don't have Jupyter Notebook, you can use the Anaconda framework, which includes Jupyter Notebook.

## How to Run Code
Before running the project code, make sure you have the required packages installed. You can install them using the following command:
bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost matplotlib seaborn

# To run the code, follow these steps:

## Clone this GitHub repository:
You can clone the GitHub repository using the following command:

bash
git clone https://github.com/CHRISTOFORJOHN7/IBM_project.git

Then, navigate to the project directory:

bash
cd IBM_project

### Open the Jupyter Notebook for the code phase:
If you have Anaconda installed, open the Anaconda Command Prompt and run the following command:

bash
jupyter notebook

This command opens Jupyter Notebook in your web browser and automatically displays the files in the current directory. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the code. You can run the code cells by pressing "Ctrl + Enter" or by clicking the "Run" button in the Jupyter Notebook interface.
#### Note: The final code you need to run is named AI_Phase5.pdf.
## Final Documentation
For complete project documentation, refer to the Project Documentation (AI_Phase5.docx) file. This document contains detailed information about our project, including the code, output, and screenshots of the code's results.
